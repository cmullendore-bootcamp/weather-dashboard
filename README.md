## What is it?
The Weather Dashboard allows you to see the weather for any city. Simply provide the city name and you'll be provided with the current weather and the next 5 day forecast.

The dashboard also retains your previous city searches, allowing you to easily pull up the weather for any of your previously searched cities.
